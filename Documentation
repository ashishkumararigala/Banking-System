This program demonstrates various concepts and skills in programming, including:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

The program defines classes (Account, SavingsAccount, CreditCardAccount) to model real-world entities.
Encapsulation is used to bundle data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a class.
Inheritance:

The SavingsAccount and CreditCardAccount classes inherit from the Account class. This allows them to reuse and extend the functionality of the base class.
Polymorphism:

The apply_interest function demonstrates polymorphism by accepting different types of accounts (in this case, any account that has a deposit method) and applying interest.
User Input and Validation:

The program uses user input to gather information such as account details, deposit/withdrawal amounts, and credit card details.
Input validation is implemented to ensure that the entered account number is 12 digits long and that numeric values are entered where expected.
Exception Handling:

The program raises a ValueError exception if the account number is not exactly 12 digits long during the creation of an Account object.
Exception handling is not implemented for potential errors during user input (e.g., non-numeric input), which is an area for improvement.
Control Structures:

The program utilizes control structures such as if, while, and exit statements to control the flow of execution based on user input and conditions.
Functions:

Functions are used to encapsulate and modularize code. For example, collect_applicant_info, evaluate_eligibility, and display_results perform specific tasks.
File Structure:

The code is organized into classes and functions, demonstrating good code organization and separation of concerns.
User Interaction:

The program interacts with the user through the command line interface, prompting for information and displaying results.
Basic Financial Logic:

The program simulates basic financial transactions such as deposit, withdrawal, and interest calculation.
Conditional Statements:

Conditional statements (if, else) are used to make decisions based on certain conditions, for example, checking if the user is eligible for a credit card.
Lambda Function:

A lambda function (calculate_simple_interest) is used to represent a simple interest calculation.
Code Organization:

The code is organized with an if __name__ == "__main__": block, separating script functionality from reusable code, making it easier to use the code as a module in other programs.
Improvements can be made, such as expanding exception handling, adding more error checking, and enhancing the user interface for a more user-friendly experience.
